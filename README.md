# Python_project

Some of my self wrote python project...
Just want to save these online

If you want to run my programm,
Library "Pygame" should be installed before you do that,
type "pip3 install pygame" or "pip install pygame" in your command line.

There are 

1. Lottery programm with visualization
2. Minesweeper (not able und generate the board depends on where the User clicks at the first time :( , hope someone would help! I would appreciate that!)
3. Tic Tac Toe [Have fun ;)]
4. Gobang(come from Tic Tac Toe), with Undo Redo, pretty cool!Cancel changes
5. Flappybird (Very very object oriented programming, it made a lot of fun for me by making this game!)
7. !!! Chess Engine !!! 
    - Very object oriented Programming, the best Programm i've ever wrote and i am proud of it
    - Every rules in chess are programmed in (include check, checkmate, stalemate, en passant, move restriction and so on...)!
    - Able to castle; 
    - Able to move with drag & drop; 
    - Able to mark with right click; 
    - Able to load fen like this("r1bqk2r/1pppbppp/p1n2n2/4p3/B3P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQR1K1 b", 
            You just need to give this fen code where the board object is initialized) 
    - Promotion (to different pieces)
    - undo redo moves
    - so on...
8. Othello (You might never heart about that, but thats a international boardgame! Very interesting and exciting)
